# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Linting, Testing, Building and Deploying

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  pull_request:
    types: [ opened, synchronize, reopened ] # this actions are default
    branches: [ "main" ]  # this is the target branch
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # this syntax is the same as above
      # - develop
      # - hotfix/*  --> hotfix/new hotfix/old
      # - hotfix/** --> hotfix/new/new hotfix/old/old
    ## you may only define one of `paths` and `paths-ignore` for a single event
    # paths:
    #   - "./" # this is the path to the files that will trigger the workflow
    # paths-ignore:
    #   - ".github/workflows/*" # this is the path to the files that will be ignored
